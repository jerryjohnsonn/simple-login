Hello everyone, it's Jerry here...

This repo is about the simple login and logout, in this project I used:

- Bcrypt
- Express

Actually this demo was showed by a Youtuber named Web Dev Simplified, I'm just practicing here

Thankyou if you love how the visual and logic work, you should visit Kyle's Youtube Channel. But if you love to read and understand the code line by line, you can understand my Github code and feel free to clone it
